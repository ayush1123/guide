title: Unsupervised Learning
---
#### Introduction
Unsupervised Learning is a class of Machine Learning techniques to find the patterns in data. The data given to unsupervised algorithm are not labelled, which means only the input variables(X) are given with no corresponding output variables. Here, the algorithms are left to themselves to discover interesting structures in the data.

#### Important Terminology

1. FEATURE: An input variable used in making predictions.
2. PREDICTIONS: A modelâ€™s output when provided with an input example.
3. EXAMPLE: One row of a data set. An example contains one or more features and possibly a label.
4. LABEL: Result of the feature.
Example:
		
		Clustering: Is used for exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. Take a collection of 1,000,000 different genes, and find a way to automatically group these genes into groups that are somehow similar or related by different variables, such as lifespan, location, roles, and so on.
		
		Few more Examples:
		Suppose you have data for an E-commerce site. You have a list of people and things they have ordered online this last week. You can now use Clustering Algorithms and find the pattern in the data, predict the buying trend and formulate the business strategy as per the trend.
